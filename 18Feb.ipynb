        "\n",
        "REST is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and focuses on resource-based interactions. It is inherently stateless, meaning each request from a client to the server must contain all the necessary information for processing. REST typically uses lightweight data formats like JSON or XML, making it simpler and faster to use compared to SOAP. Its stateless nature and support for various data formats allow REST to be highly scalable and flexible, which is why it is commonly used for web services and mobile applications.\n",

        "SOAP, on the other hand, is a protocol with a more rigid framework that uses XML for messaging. It can operate over a variety of application layer protocols, not just HTTP. SOAP supports stateful operations, meaning it can maintain context across multiple requests. It is known for its strict standards and built-in features like WS-Security for security and WS-ReliableMessaging for reliable communication. While SOAPs comprehensive standards make it suitable for enterprise-level applications requiring high security and formal contracts, this rigidity and the overhead associated with XML formatting can lead to slower performance and greater complexity compared to REST."
