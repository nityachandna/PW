        "Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that is often used to create web applications or APIs. In the context of a web scraping project, Flask can be used for several purposes:\n",
        "Web Interface: To create a web interface for users to interact with the scraping tool. For example, users can trigger scraping tasks via a web form.\n",
        "API: To expose the scraped data via a RESTful API, allowing other applications or users to access the data programmatically.\n",
        "Data Presentation: To serve the scraped data in a structured format, such as HTML pages or JSON responses, for easy consumption and visualization.\n",
